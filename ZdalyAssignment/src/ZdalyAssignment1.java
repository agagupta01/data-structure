/*Problem
		 1:

			 There
			  are multiple parallel universes. Each person in the universe has an identity `id` and a power. Power can be a positive or negative integer. 
			  All people are divided into families identified by `family_id`. A special creature from 4th dimension has been given
			  a task to 


			 List
			  families in a particular universe



			 Check
			  if families with given family_id have same power in all universes. If powers donâ€™t match then family_id is unbalanced



			 Find
			  unbalanced family_ids



			 Balance
			  given family_id


			 You
			  have to help him by providing REST API to store the data of universes and to do the above tasks. 
			  If he is happy he might give you a portal gun to hop between universes. Best of luck.


			 --


			 You
			  can use any Java/Javascript backend framework with MySQL/PostgreSQL



			 Please
			  provide a README and seed data for testing the APIs
